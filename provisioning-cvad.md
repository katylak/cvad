# Provisioning Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops for IBM Cloud
{: #provisioning-cvad}

## Provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.cvad_short}} service
{: #provisioning-cvad-cloud-catalog}

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.cvad_full_notm}}, you receive the following components:
* Hypervisors - You get to choose the configuration and quantity of bare metal servers during the ordering process.
* 3 x Cloud Connectors on public virtual server instances with Windows 2019 OS.
* 1 x Active Directory server on a public virtual server instance with Windows 2016 OS.
* 1 x DHCP server on a public virtual server instance with CentOS to dynamically allocate IPs to the virtual machines.
* 1 x proxy server on a public virtual server instance with CentOS to allow access to the internet for both Cloud Connectors and desktops.
* File Storage with the capacity that you choose during the ordering process.
* Primary and portable subnets on a VLAN. 

All of the servers and virtual desktops are provisioned in IBM's private network.
{: note}

If you ordered CVAD with Citrix Hypervisors, you receive:

*	Citrix Hypervisors - You get to choose the configuration and quantity of bare metal servers during the ordering process.
*	File Storage with the capacity that you choose during the ordering process.

If you ordered CVAD with VMware ESXi Hosts, you receive:

*	VMware ESXi hosts -  You need to choose the configuration and quantity of bare metal servers during the ordering process. The VMware cluster is configured with these ESXi hosts.
*	Fully configured vCenter server with NSX-V. You can choose to purchase the [licenses](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/cvad?topic=cvad-provisioning-cvad#licensing-vmware) either from IBM or use your own license keys.
*	Fully configured Active Directory server in the VMware cluster configured to enable deployments. No post-provisioning is required for this Active Directory server. This Active Directory server is in addition to the Active Directory servers used by {{site.data.keyword.cvad_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Active Directory Domain Services introduction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-adds-intro). 
*	File Storage with the capacity that you choose during the ordering process.
<!--This vSAN bullet item is phase 2 VMware-->
<!--â€¢	vSAN storage based on the capacity of the disks you chose during the ordering process.-->
